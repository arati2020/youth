Due largely to funding gaps, there is an acute shortage for nutrition commodities - namely Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) and Ready- to-Use Supplementary Food (RUSF) - for nutrition rehabilitation in children under age five suffering from AM. As a result, the Mozambican Government requested partners to support its rehabilitation programs. In response to this request, UNICEF will conduct a 24 month pilot in two non-emergency districts in the Central/North region to test the effectiveness of simplified alternative treatment protocols for Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) & Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM), to inform a more efficient and sustainable protocol for the government-owned nutritional rehabilitation Program (PRN). This pilot will produce results leading to more lives saved for less cost, greater community awareness, and empowerment for prevention and treatment of malnutrition. In addition, UNICEF will provide support to the promising m-Health-based mobile application, UpScale. The Government embraced UpScale as the solution for the chronic data gaps at the community level with its community health cadre. UNICEF will work with the National Program of Community Health Workers (APEs), the nutrition department, key stakeholders in nutrition and UpScale, and USAID/Mozambique to improve community data systems for nutrition and reduce missed opportunities and timely quality nutrition services among children under five, pregnant women and adolescent girls.","SPSD              Account          MO           Program         Direct         PO         Total

The World Health Organization and the President’s Malaria Initiative recommend regular monitoring of the therapeutic efficacy of the antimalarials used for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria. In Mozambique, the treatment of uncomplicated malaria is based on two artemisinin fixed dose combinations: Artemether-Lumefantrine and Amodiaquine-Artesunate. This activity will use FY 2021 funds to assess the therapeutic efficacy of the two combination therapies employed for the treatment of Plasmodium falciparum uncomplicated malaria cases in Mozambique. The study will be conducted in five sentinel sites, distributed across the three regions of the country. The results of this study will inform the process of defining malaria treatment policies for Mozambique.","SPSD           Account           MO             Program         Direct          PO          Total

Additionally, the activity will use FY 2021 funds to work with up to six private sector companies to provide TB education and to train cough officers in the workplace, with potential to expand these activities to include screening and referral.","SPSD               Account         MO          Program         Direct        PO        Total

PRONASAR's implementation plan includes investments from: the GRM; a Joint Fund financed by development partners; and additional partner funding. USAID and the U.K.’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) have signed a Delegated Cooperation Agreement that provides for funding to the PRONASAR Joint Fund and is supporting technical assistance and construction of WASH infrastructure in rural areas. With FY 2021 funding, this activity will improve access to, and management of, WASH services in select rural areas of Mozambique in line with the GRM’s water strategy. PRONASAR's strengthening of water sector governance, financing, and institutions--priorities under the U.S. Global Water Strategy-- will complement existing USAID WASH activities by supporting government and local systems’ delivery of sustainable water and sanitation services. The strengthening of GRM WASH management and delivery systems is critical to Mozambique's goal of universal water access. PRONASAR will work in communities that lack sustainable access to safe water and sanitation and that are at high risk for diarrheal disease. PRONASAR will initially focus on activities within rural communities and peri-urban areas in the northern provinces. PRONOSAR will build 120 water supply systems; establish strategies and tools for performance monitoring; design tools to support the management of private water licensing authorities; develop a communication and advocacy strategy for social behavior change for open defecation free communities; develop products to pilot decentralized stations for emptying and treatment of fecal sludge in 5 districts; and produce a study on the energy efficiency of water supply systems.","SPSD               Account         MO           Program         Direct         PO         Total

LMSC will provide support and oversight to the implementation of the Mission’s new mechanism, CHEGAR, which will allow the Mission to contract directly with private sector entities and will improve working relationships between private sector actors and the public health system. Under LMSC’s oversight, CHEGAR will assume commodities distribution to the end of the supply chain. Monthly integrated deliveries will arrive in all provinces. LMSC will focus on strengthening the capacity of key stakeholders to support the successful execution of outsourced distribution in all provinces. This includes effectively building political support from the government at multiple levels, identifying and engaging the local private sector, applying proven transportation and logistics processes, and developing and implementing a monitoring and evaluation plan. LMSC will engage and build Central Medical Stores’ capacity for managing Fourth Party Logistics (4PL) contracts and managing and assessing the 4PL’s performance.","SPSD                 Account         MO           Program        Direct        PO       Total

By building the capacity of local CSOs to plan, finance, and implement solutions to local development challenges, the Mission will help ensure the sustainability of development initiatives and will broaden the partner base for future initiatives. The LEAD activity will address key capacity development gaps across sectors which limit the effectiveness of organizations to achieve sustainable and significant impact, be accountable to their constituents, and identify and respond to funding opportunities. This activity will fund assessments to identify USAID recipients’ areas of need to be addressed through technical assistance, training, mentoring, coaching, and support. It will also provide oversight to ensure sustainable results. Based on the assessment results, the activity will facilitate the preparation of a prioritized action plan by the implementing partner with estimated completion dates, individuals responsible for completion, and other necessary data for implementation and follow-up. The LEAD activity was recently awarded and will be funded with a mix of prior year, current year, and future year funds. Funding sources will include nutrition, maternal and child health, family planning, PEPFAR, education, democracy rights and governance, and other program areas to be determined.","SPSD                 Account         MO           Program         Direct        PO        Total

With FY 2021 funds, PIRCOM will continue disseminating messages through its network of trained religious leaders. PIRCOM will center its dissemination activities on Community Radio dialogues with small groups of men and women (maximum group size of 17 due to current COVID-19 restrictions). Additionally, religious leaders will use sermons to pass key messages to their congregations. PIRCOM will also introduce a package designed for adolescents which includes a family planning component that creates a referral and counter-referral system between the health unit and religious leaders. PIRCOM will train referral health unit staff in select districts to help facilitate and manage these referrals. PIRCOM will interact with boys and girls at Islamic schools, using sports, debates, and reading contests as interactive vehicles. The activity will incorporate nutrition, maternal and child health, family planning, malaria, HIV and COVID activities, to ensure a cohesive, high-impact, integrated approach, able to reach under-served populations.","SPSD                  Account         MO          Program         Direct      PO        Total

FTF-RESINA will focus on assessing the current context of the RFZ to identify the most appropriate system-level interventions to address drivers of chronic poverty, while also working to mitigate negative impacts from recurrent natural and human-caused disasters. These assessments will be used to develop a context- specific and context-responsive approach.

This activity is a follow-on award to the six-year $14.8 million ECOSMART: The Alliance for Ecosystem Conservation Systems, Markets, and Tourism activity (2015-2021), implemented by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) in partnership with the Mozambique National Administration for Conservation Areas (ANAC). The activity will provide technical assistance to implement a co- management agreement with the Niassa Special Reserve; grants to Luwire and Chuilexi Wildlife Conservancies to support community-based natural resources management and alternative livelihoods; equipment, supplies, and rations to support counter-wildlife trafficking aerial, vehicle, and foot patrols by trained government rangers and locally-employed scouts; and environmental awareness activities to support stewardship of endangered wildlife, including African elephants, lions, and painted wolves. The intervention will build upon ECOSMART’s achievement of zero elephant poaching in Niassa Special Reserve since May 2018. With FY 2021 funds, the activity will: strengthen the capability of rangers to enforce conservation laws and regulations in partnership with a State/INL grant; mitigate human-wildlife conflict; strengthen community-based fire management in partnership with the US Forest Service (e.g., controlled burns and fire breaks); coordinate with concessionaires in the co-management of the reserve; and strengthen community-based natural resource management and sustainable livelihood opportunities. This activity will engage with conservation-friendly private safari operators, counter transnational criminal networks with aerial surveillance and ranger patrols, and promote the security and resilience of ecosystem services to political, economic, and natural shocks and stresses.","SPSD          Account           MO             Program           Direct         PO          Total

The RCC activity will blend Biodiversity and Feed the Future resources (possibly including other funding sources to be determined), to improve the resilience of coastal communities with rich, yet fragile land and marine ecosystems at risk of climatic shocks and human-inflicted degradation. Activities will include conservation of coastal and marine ecosystems (e.g., mangroves, seagrasses, coral reefs) and important fish habitats to support improved climate resilience, fisheries management (e.g., community-managed no off-take zones), food security, private sector development and job creation, and sustainable livelihoods. The Implementing Partner(s) for the RCC activity will work across public, private, civil society, and religious institution stakeholders to identify and promote improved resilience of households, communities, and regional systems. The activity will focus on increasing skills and employment opportunities for youth to improve livelihoods and reduce pressures on natural resources. There is growing evidence of ongoing recruitment from coastal communities in this region by groups engaged in violent extremism in Cabo Delgado, which is exacerbated by extensive poverty in these coastal communities. The activity will support sustainable economic opportunities for large numbers of people, particularly for youth and women, while having positive impacts on areas of highly biodiverse marine ecosystems.","SPSD             Account         MO           Program          Direct          PO           Total

Resilient Gorongosa is a Global Development Alliance to achieve nature-based economic growth and conservation in the Gorongosa landscape. Since 2008, USAID has invested $20 million, (matched by American philanthropist Greg Carr), toward the conservation and development of Gorongosa National Park. By reintroducing key species lost during the civil war, enforcing conservation laws, and improving livelihoods, the Gorongosa Project has restored wildlife populations and changed the perception of the park among neighboring communities. Under a 25-year strategic public-private co-management agreement, the activity will: restore and protect natural capital (forests, water, wildlife) for tourism and ecosystem services; strengthen conservation enterprises that reinvest profits into the project; expand access to education, health, and water services, particularly for women and girls. The activity will scale successful approaches, to include: positive youth development for girls; Youth and Teacher Clubs; and Model Moms, traditional birth attendants, and community health extensionists. Through technical assistance, training, community outreach, and the procurement of equipment and supplies, the activity will strengthen conservation science and community-based natural resources management; forest ranger capability to arrest illegal loggers and poachers; adolescent numeracy, literacy and life skills, particularly for girls; farmers’ access to buyers and suppliers; family planning, maternal and child health, and nutrition services; and improved access to and management of water supply and sanitation. Sustainable coffee production on Mount Gorongosa and cashew farming will support localized disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of former combatants and their families.","SPSD                Account          MO           Program         Direct        PO         Total

Using FY 2021 funds, the activity will strengthen policy implementation and institutional capacity to deliver WASH services; increase availability of water infrastructure in small towns and peri-urban areas; improve access to clean water and sanitation (particularly for women and girls who typically shoulder most household responsibilities including water collection and childcare); support access to finance and governance for private sector water providers; and accelerate the adoption and maintenance of key WASH behaviors. The TW activity is expected to test and scale-up innovative, consumer-responsive, affordable water and sanitation service delivery models. Additionally, it will improve the capacity of providers and communities to manage water services. The activity will also roll out innovative models for community water management that address payments, rehabilitation, and systems sustainability.","SPSD              Account         MO           Program         Direct        PO         Total

Community radio stations play an important role in Mozambique’s information landscape, potentially reaching two-thirds of Mozambicans. Thus, using FY 2021 funding, this activity will specifically seek to improve the quality of community radio stations’ operations, programming, and increase their financial sustainability. Using a web-based information exchange portal to increase revenues, this activity aims to improve the journalistic skills of voluntary journalists and enhance their community engagement by strengthening linkages among citizens, the private sector, civil society, and local governments. Specific interventions will include: training CR journalists in basic and advanced journalistic skills; enhancing managers’ and decision-makers’ business and operation management skills; streamlining community radio operations; supporting development and implementation of business plans; marketing initiatives to increase revenues; and engaging local stakeholders to improve transparency and accountability in local communities. Additionally, the activity will address gender/Gender Based Violence (GBV) issues in the core journalism training programs and will establish a network of gender/GBV focal points at partner community radio stations, aiming to improve gender/GBV awareness, knowledge, journalistic techniques to address such issues, and increase the space and attention paid to gender/GBV in the media. Training sessions will capacitate the community radios to produce and disseminate quality content around decentralization, accountability and more.","SPSD                 Account       MO           Program        Direct       PO        Total

LOGOS will conduct activities with all levels of the GRM, including support to central ministries responsible for coordination of sub-national units of government, as well as technical assistance to all principal types of sub-national government subject to coordination by the central government (provinces, districts, and municipalities). The purpose of LOGOS is to engage with participating subnational government entities to strengthen their effectiveness, transparency, and accountability, and to improve service delivery in health, education, and WASH sectors in targeted geographic areas. Using FY 2021 funding, LOGOS will engage with local government entities to improve public financial management and increase local revenue collection. Additionally, the activity will strengthen accountability mechanisms, such as inspection services, in an effort to reduce absenteeism among health care staff and primary school teachers. The activity will also address drug and medical supply leakage and poor access to safely managed drinking water and basic sanitation services. Furthermore, the activity will track reforms, to include the issuance of land titles, to improve the ease of doing business in local environments, in sub-national geographic focus areas.","SPSD               Account          MO          Program         Direct        PO        Total

This includes direct support to provincial governments, through Government-to-Government (G2Gs) agreements. The overall strategy is to shift to a model in which contractors provide more technical assistance to strengthen local capacity and to establish G2G agreements with provincial level departments of health to lead implementation. With FY 2021 funds, the Mission will establish a G2G instrument with the Nampula Provincial Health Services to support implementation of malaria entomological monitoring and routine surveillance activities. Nampula is Mozambique’s most populous province, with some of the worst health indicators in the country. According to the 2018 Malaria Indicator Survey data, 48% of children 6-59 months old had a malaria infection. The entomological monitoring activities will be implemented in three sites of Nampula Province. They will include support for assessment of malaria vector density, species composition, monitoring of the quality of IRS operations and insecticide decay rates. The routine surveillance activities will include support for the implementation of data-driven integrated supervision and for improving data use for decision-making.","SPSD                Account          MO           Program         Direct       PO        Total

UAN also works with the Government of Mozambique (GRM) to (1) strengthen the human resource capacity of the Ministry of Health to plan and manage nutrition programming and (2) improve multi-sectoral nutrition planning, programming, and evaluation. In a move toward self-reliance, the Mission chose a local organization to lead the flagship nutrition activity. Realizing that technical and organizational capacity may be limited among Mozambican organizations, the Mission built in technical support for the first two-to-three years of the bilateral project. With FY 2021 funds, UAN will provide TA to ADPP in: social behavior change and gender programming; sanitation and hygiene programming; multisectoral nutrition programming; monitoring, evaluation, and learning; and integration of Early Childhood development topics into TN’s programming. Using FY 2021 funding, UAN will strengthen the human resource capacity at national and Nampula province levels by building capacity to provide supportive supervision for health facility level staff that provide nutrition services. The activity will also strengthen pre- and in-service training for this nutrition cadre. This project will also work with the GRM and community stakeholders to build skills and competencies to effectively implement multi-sectoral coordination activities, resulting in improved nutrition of pregnant and lactating women and children under age two. Currently, intersectoral food security and nutrition efforts are poorly coordinated, and a major focus will be strengthening newly established Food Security and Nutrition Councils in charge of these efforts at provincial and district levels. UAN is expected to transition most of its interventions to TN by the end of FY 2022.","SPSD                Account           MO            Program         Direct        PO        Total

Additionally, a series of recent natural disasters has increased vulnerabilities to vaccine-preventable diseases, including vaccine-derived poliovirus and measles. The MOMENTUM Routine Immunization Transformation and Equity (M-RITE) mechanism’s main goal is to sustainably strengthen routine immunization programs in Nampula and Zambézia provinces to 1) overcome the entrenched obstacles contributing to stagnating and declining immunization rates; 2) address the barriers to reaching zero-dose and under-immunized children with lifesaving vaccines and other health services; and 3) apply best practices co-creating innovations to provide quality and equitable immunization services. With FY 2021 funds, M-RITE will provide targeted technical assistance to the Expanded Program in Immunization (EPI) by strengthening coordination and planning processes; increasing demand, delivery, and overall uptake of routine immunization services; promoting the generation and use of quality data; informing policies; and supporting introduction of new vaccines. M-RITE will complement, and will collaborate, and coordinate with other USAID-supported mechanisms to ensure effectiveness of USAID support to Maternal and Child Health and Family Planning programs in Mozambique. M-RITE will also partner with local organizations, government institutions and communities to close equity gaps in immunization services, and improve service experience and immunization outcomes. Specific technical assistance will include support to Reaching Every District/Reaching Every Community/Reaching Every Child (RED/REC) strategies, improvement of disease surveillance, and leadership and management of the EPI at all levels.","SPSD            Account          MO            Program          Direct          PO           Total

CHEGAR aims to do this by establishing an effective and efficient transportation system for medical commodities in all provinces. The activity will deliver commodities to an estimated 1600 sites across Mozambique. To improve commodity availability and strengthen the supply chain, with FY 2021 funding, Maternal and Child Health (MCH), Nutrition, PMI/Malaria, and Family Planning (FP) funds will support last mile distribution from provincial level down to service delivery points. PMI support will leverage broader, cross-element USAID investments in last mile distribution. For FP, MCH, nutrition, and malaria, funds will support the distribution of a range of contraceptives and essential MCH, nutrition, and malaria commodities. CHEGAR focuses on addressing the last mile of the public health supply chain, where challenges are most acute and current systems and support structures are insufficient. This activity will bring a specialized technical and functional focus to a fragmented supply chain challenged by inadequate infrastructure, human resources, accountability, and information systems. CHEGAR will both build the capacity of the private sector to respond to government needs and build government capacity to manage contracts with the private sector to effectively outsource transportation services for the distribution of medicines and supplies. In this way, two key pillars of self-reliance will be addressed through one project. CHEGAR was designed with the intention of transitioning management of this work to the government. The current Last Mile Supply Chain activity will provide support and oversight to the implementation of this mechanism.","SPSD                Account         MO           Program         Direct        PO        Total

This includes direct support to provincial governments, through Government-to-Government (G2Gs) agreements. The overall strategy is to shift to a model in which contractors provide more technical assistance to strengthen local capacity and to establish G2G agreements with provincial level departments of health to lead implementation. With FY 2021 funds, the Mission will establish a G2G instrument with the Zambézia Provincial Health Services to support implementation of the following malaria interventions: entomological monitoring, indoor residual spraying, and routine surveillance. Zambézia is Mozambique’s second most populous province with some of the worst health indicators in the country. According to the 2018 Malaria Indicator Survey data, 44% of children 6-59 months old had a malaria infection. The entomological monitoring activities will be implemented in five districts and will include an assessment of malaria vector density, species composition, monitoring of the quality of IRS operations and insecticide decay rates. The indoor residual spraying activities will cover approximately 350,000 structures in five districts. These funds will cover the subsidies for spray operators, team leaders, district and provincial staff, spray operator breakfasts and vehicle hire. Finally, the routine surveillance activities will include support for the implementation of data-driven integrated supervision and for improving data use for decision-making.","SPSD               Account          MO           Program         Direct        PO         Total

Through the centrally managed WASH-FIN activity, USAID provided technical assistance to analyze UNICEF’s concept note, which discussed the establishment of an investment fund for water supply and sanitation in small towns, based on the Government of Mozambique’s public-private partnership model for private sector engagement. WASH-FIN is now designing a feasibility study to explore the establishment of a blended finance fund to catalyze the development of water supply systems across underserved communities in Mozambique, principally those in designated ‘small towns’. In parallel, UNICEF, through the GIBB engineering firm, is conducting an assessment of water supply in 35 secondary towns. The objective of this study is to further examine the UNICEF concept, as well as the merits of alternative fund concepts, and perform a comprehensive evaluation of options, ultimately leading to the selection of the fund structure presenting the greatest potential. The Mission will use FY 2021 funding to implement the preferred approach identified in this feasibility study, either through a grant to UNICEF or a loan guarantee.","SPSD           Account          MO            Program         Direct            PO          Total

Little progress has been made in protecting girls from gender-based violence (GBV), particularly sexual violence. Additionally, poor facilities, to include unsafe school bathrooms lacking water add to school insecurity for female students. These factors result in elevated school dropout rates for girls. The Advancing Girls Education (AGE) activity is a 5-year project that will make schools a safer place for girls aged 10-19, at risk of dropping out of school due to physical, sexual, or psychological violence, teen pregnancy, or child marriage, thereby increasing female student retention rates. The Mission will use FY 2021 funds to promote female-centered education by increasing community participation and accountability to reduce barriers to female education. Through student and community engagement, the activity will address harmful social norms and stereotypes, and will enlighten students and community members on issues related to GBV. Focusing on primary and secondary schools in Zambézia and Nampula target districts, AGE will identify constraints to female education. AGE will also target known barriers such as early marriages, underage pregnancies, chronic teacher and student absenteeism, limited support at home, and poor school facilities that constrain school attendance, learning outcomes, successful school completion and transition to adulthood. AGE will collaborate with other existing USAID family planning, community health worker, and behavior change activities to integrate school-based health committees and community health worker and family planning platforms to conduct activities aimed at the prevention of early child marriage, and the adoption of key healthy behaviors.","SPSD             Account          MO            Program         Direct         PO           Total

Since March 2020, IS-M has orchestrated its most brazen and sophisticated assaults, including the occupation and partial destruction of four district capitals. It has also attempted to win over citizens’ hearts and minds with more concerted efforts to integrate into communities and distribute stolen loot with them. Cabo Delgado Province has a large youth population, 21% unemployment, poor access to education (especially for young women), and high rates of early marriage and gender-based violence. Unfulfilled aspirations create fertile recruiting grounds for IS-M in Cabo Delgado. To address this situation, the Mission will use FY 2021 funds to secure economic pathways for youth, women, and IDPs through the creation of market-relevant technical courses. Additionally, the Mission will invite youth entrepreneurs to submit business plans and will support authors of the best plans with mentoring and startup funding. The activity will offer counselling to help youth choose appropriate career development paths. The activity will also collaborate with local primary schools to identify children, prioritizing girls, to receive scholarships to facilitate a smooth transition into, and completion of, secondary education. Additionally, the activity will provide teacher training course scholarships to grade 12 graduates.","SPSD              Account         MO           Program          Direct        PO         Total

In an effort to address persistent poor reading outcomes exacerbated by the lost instruction time resulting from COVID-19-related school closures, the Improving Learning Outcomes in Primary Education (SABER) activity will provide remedial education to students in grades 1-3. Additionally, in an effort to increase the likelihood that students successfully complete primary education, SABER will help the Ministry of Education extend bilingual instruction to students in primary grades 4, 5 and 6 in selected schools located in the two northern provinces of Nampula and Zambézia. The activity will provide initial instruction in the child’s first language and will support student transition to Portuguese as described in the Ministry’s bilingual education strategy. The Mission will use FY 2021 funding to deliver high-quality instruction to improve reading and math skills in grades 1-6 within select schools, while transitioning from local languages to Portuguese. The activity will develop teaching competencies by providing pedagogical training to teachers and school principals in teaching early grade reading and math skills using a bilingual approach. Using the bilingual training model, this activity will also improve training skills in areas of gender sensitivity and classroom management. Funding will also provide technical assistance in creating bilingual education testing tools, bilingual textbooks, and teaching and learning materials.

Niassa has one of the highest unmet needs for FP and the lowest percentage of facilities offering services for adolescents resulting in more than 60% of adolescents having already begun childbearing. Niassa also has one of the highest institutional maternal mortality rates in the country. As a result, Mozambique’s Ministry of Health set reducing maternal and neonatal mortality as a strategic development priority. The Mission will support this priority by funding the following objectives: 1) increase coverage of and access to quality comprehensive and basic emergency obstetric and neonatal care and essential maternal/newborn health care; and 2) increase access to and utilization of family planning services. This G2G mechanism will align with Mozambican and Mission strategies to reduce maternal, neonatal and child mortality, and to increase utilization of family planning services, while also serving to strengthen GRM financial and management systems.","SPSD                  Account        MO           Program         Direct       PO        Total

This project will build on the previous flagship project’s work in Nampula and Sofala provinces, and initiate activities in Zambézia province. Activities will focus on increasing demand for FP, adoption of healthy reproductive behaviors, expansion of equitable quality service delivery options and improved leadership, commitment, and coordination to support family planning/reproductive health (FP/RH) at all levels of the health system. This new activity will prioritize youth, both in and out of the school system, and males. It will also continue to work with couples and women with high unmet need for FP/RH. It will reduce social and cultural barriers to the uptake of quality FP/RH and Maternal and Child Health services, scale-up implementation of high impact practices and innovative strategies, support client- centered quality FP/RH service delivery implemented at scale, strengthen capacity of local implementing partners to manage and implement voluntary FP/RH programs, develop and test innovative private sector approaches to address gaps in the FP/RH market, and build GRM capacity to deliver and lead the FP/RH program at central, provincial and district levels. The project will leverage antenatal care and postnatal care platforms to encourage integrated quality MNCH care and FP/RH services. In addition, the activity will provide technical assistance, mentoring, and training for data management including commodity quantification, forecasting and planning. The new activity will also help the country achieve commitments under the FP2030 Partnership.","SPSD               Account         MO           Program        Direct        PO        Total

Yet it receives significantly less funding than other infectious diseases like HIV. Data collection systems for TB are antiquated and less robust than most other disease surveillance systems. Therefore, TB data collection systems are unable to provide data in a timely and comprehensive fashion, which leads to significant delays in understanding program trajectory. TB monitoring and evaluation systems and data analysis need to be rethought for the 21st century. In an effort to address this need and to better understand TB, TB/HIV program performance, and to inform strategic objectives and quality improvement initiatives, USAID/Mozambique will buy into Panagora, a global health and data analysis activity to create an analytic platform that will allow for joint management and performance review across the entire Ministry of Health (MOH) and USG supported TB and TB/HIV Portfolio. With FY 2021 funds, Panagora will focus on updating dashboards for the four PEPFAR TB/HIV indicators and customized TB monthly reports. Additionally, Panagora will develop a shared analytic TB dashboard and will have a strategic information secondment in the MOH. Moreover, the activity will support TB Diagnostic Network Assessment and data analytic support for multiplexing.","SPSD                 Account         MO          Program        Direct       PO        Total

In an effort to assist Mozambique on its journey toward self-reliance, USAID/Mozambique is gradually expanding its support to local partners. The overall strategy is to shift to a model in which contractors provide more technical assistance to strengthen local capacity and to establish G2G agreements with provincial level departments of health to lead implementation. With this G2G activity, the Mission will increase SPS Sofala’s diagnostic capacity; improve the quality of TB samples; increase TB case detection rate and TB screening capacity; and improve data collection from all TB diagnosed cases. These activities are in alignment with the National Tuberculosis Program and USAID/Mozambique priorities and goals of strengthening the institutional capacity of provincial and district health services to diagnose and manage TB, and of supporting and improving the procurement of TB Lab supplies.","SPSD                Account           MO           Program         Direct       PO        Total

Through this new mechanism, USAID/Mozambique will continue to strengthen the Ministry of Health’s (MOH) capacity in management and service provision at provincial, district, and community levels, through supervision and training on case management, malaria in pregnancy, monitoring and evaluation and program management. This award will also support system strengthening activities to improve reporting, data quality and service delivery. Implementation of activities will be co-led by the Government of Mozambique (GRM) and carried out in coordination with other donors (the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, and the Gates Foundation). With FY 2021 funds, this mechanism will operate in Zambézia, Nampula and Manica Provinces. In Zambézia and Nampula provinces, implementation will be complemented by the routine surveillance activities supported through government-to-government agreements with the respective provincial governments. The case management activities will bolster the malaria laboratory quality assurance at provincial, district and health facility levels. The M&E component will include strengthening of the health management information system at the provincial, district, and health facility levels, to improve data quality and decision-making by the GRM. The implementation of these activities will be closely coordinated with other activities supported by PMI and USAID in these provinces.","SPSD               Account         MO           Program         Direct       PO        Total

This G2G will support implementation of HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis (TB) activities. In an effort to support Mozambique on its journey toward self-reliance, USAID/Mozambique is gradually expanding its support to local partners. The overall strategy is to shift to a model in which contractors provide more technical assistance to strengthen local capacity and to establish G2G agreements with provincial level departments of health to lead implementation. This G2G will support SPS and Tete Provincial Directorate of Health to implement trainings for Health Professionals in TB diagnosis and management, on the job training and mentorship for Health Professionals, conducting supervision visits in all districts of Tete province and procurement of TB Lab supplies and equipment. These activities are in alignment with the National Tuberculosis Program and USAID/Mozambique priorities and goals of strengthening the provincial and district health services institutional capacity to implement TB case management and diagnosis; and supporting and improving the procurement of TB Lab supplies.","SPSD                 Account        MO          Program        Direct       PO       Total

With respect to HRH, the activity will aim to augment the quality and quantity of competent HRH at facility level in order to advance health-related goals. This will likely involve working closely with Government of Mozambique officials on hiring, deploying, capacity building, and retention strategies for HRH. Additionally, with increased engagement in direct financing to sub-national level health government authorities, selected Public Financial Management, Governance and Reporting technical assistance interventions may be necessary to build public sector capacity to better manage and execute public and donor funds, thereby enhancing the transparency of public resources use and allocation to improve the health of Mozambicans. The theory of change is that by increasing the number of competent health workers at high volume sites, and by improving management and governance practices at national and subnational levels, health authorities will achieve better results in MCH, Malaria, FP and HIV, reduce mortality and morbidity, and improve the health of Mozambicans, specifically women and children.

Activities will include support to community radio programming, interpersonal communication activities, and activities related to capacity-building of community structures for malaria social and behavior change. The interpersonal communication activities will be implemented through Community-Based Organizations (CBOs) and will include training of influential leaders, community dialogues, and community health talks. The Mission will implement activities under this mechanism in Manica, Zambézia, Nampula and Cabo Delgado provinces. The implementation of these activities will be closely coordinated with other activities supported by the President’s Malaria Initiative and USAID/Mozambique in these provinces. Ongoing violence in Cabo Delgado suggests that radio programming will play a major role in implementation and that community-based activities will be limited to the districts considered safe.","SPSD               Account         MO          Program         Direct       PO        Total

Violent extremism in Cabo Delgado has displaced more than 800 million people and has created a climate of fear and distrust in communities. Project activities currently develop community-led economic and social opportunities that strengthen positive relationships and support systems, creating conditions for community members to co-exist peacefully and resolve tensions through non-violent means. Current implementation occurs in three districts and eight communities in southern Cabo Delgado. Interventions include income generation activities, community revitalization, government capacity building, and research. Income generation opportunities are identified through community-based planning exercises, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews. Community revitalization projects increase community engagement and well-being through infrastructure projects and community livelihood opportunities. Community committees with diverse representation are developed to oversee the projects. The Mission will use FY 2021 funds to extend community stabilization activities in northern Mozambique, which will focus on strengthening social cohesion among IDPs and host community members. Funds will support activities to increase service provision and to build confidence between communities and authorities. Activities will be context specific interventions directed by flexible, adaptable contextual research.","SPSD             Account          MO           Program         Direct         PO          Total
