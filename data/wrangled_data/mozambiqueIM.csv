The overall strategy is to shift to a model in which contractors provide more technical assistance to strengthen local capacity and to establish G2G agreements with provincial level departments of health to lead implementation. Niassa is the most extensive province with the highest total fertility rate (6.6) and population growth (4.9% a year) in the country, and it has among the worst MNCH and Family Planning (FP) indicators in Mozambique. Niassa has one of the highest unmet needs for FP and the lowest percentage of facilities offering services for adolescents resulting in more than 60% of adolescents having already begun childbearing. Niassa also has one of the highest institutional maternal mortality rates in the country. As a result, Mozambique’s Ministry of Health set reducing maternal and neonatal mortality as a strategic development priority. The Mission will support this priority by funding the following objectives: 1) increase coverage of and access to quality comprehensive and basic emergency obstetric and neonatal care and essential maternal/newborn health care; and 2) increase access to and utilization of family planning services. This G2G mechanism will align with Mozambican and Mission strategies to reduce maternal, neonatal and child mortality, and to increase utilization of family planning services, while also serving to strengthen GRM financial and management systems.\n","\nSPSD\nAccount\nMO\nProgram\nDirect Funding\nPO  Total\nTotal Funding\nHL.6.8 Cross-cutting Health Systems Strengthening\nGHP-USAID\nICS 08/15/2018 3.2\nNot Applicable\n$360,000\n-\n$360,000\nHL.7.4 Cross-cutting Health Systems Strengthening (FP/RH)\nGHP-USAID\nICS 08/15/2018 3.2\nNot Applicable\n$101,300\n-\n$101,300\nTOTAL\n$461,300\n-\n$461,300\n",FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

This will likely involve working closely with Government of Mozambique officials on hiring, deploying, capacity building, and retention strategies for HRH. Additionally, with increased engagement in direct financing to sub-national level health government authorities, selected Public Financial Management, Governance and Reporting technical assistance interventions may be necessary to build public sector capacity to better manage and execute public and donor funds, thereby enhancing the transparency of public resources use and allocation to improve the health of Mozambicans. The theory of change is that by increasing the number of competent health workers at high volume sites, and by improving management and governance practices at national and subnational levels, health authorities will achieve better results in MCH, Malaria, FP and HIV, reduce mortality and morbidity, and improve the health of Mozambicans, specifically women and children. The Mission anticipates launching the five-year program in late 2022.\n","\nSPSD\nAccount\nMO\nProgram\nDirect Funding\nPO  Total\nTotal Funding\nHL.6.10 Host Country Strategic Information System (MCH)\nGHP-USAID\nICS 08/15/2018 3.2\nNot Applicable\n$100,000\n-\n$100,000\nTOTAL\n$100,000\n-\n$100,000\n",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

With FY 2021 funds, USAID/Mozambique will support implementation of the national social and behavior change strategy, which aims to promote uptake of key malaria prevention and treatment interventions. Activities will include support to community radio programming, interpersonal communication activities, and activities related to capacity-building of community structures for malaria social and behavior change. The interpersonal communication activities will be implemented through Community-Based Organizations (CBOs) and will include training of influential leaders, community dialogues, and community health talks. The Mission will implement activities under this mechanism in Manica, Zambézia, Nampula and Cabo Delgado provinces. The implementation of these activities will be closely coordinated with other activities supported by the President’s Malaria Initiative and USAID/Mozambique in these provinces. Ongoing violence in Cabo Delgado suggests that radio programming will play a major role in implementation and that community-based activities will be limited to the districts considered safe.\n","\nSPSD\nAccount\nMO\nProgram\nDirect Funding\nPO  Total\nTotal Funding\nHL.3.1 Diagnosis and Treatment with Artemisinin-Based Combination Therapies\nGHP-USAID\nICS 08/15/2018 3.2\nNot Applicable\n$1,297,500\n-\n$1,297,500\nTOTAL\n$1,297,500\n-\n$1,297,500\n",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

With FY 2021 funds, this activity will support the Government of Mozambique (GRM) in its efforts to strengthen existing private sector providers so as to expand private sector Maternal and Child Health (MCH) and Family Planning (FP) service delivery packages. The activity will also increase the number of Primary Health Care services to better serve an increased customer base. It will also nurture public and private partnerships in response to the need for a robust mixed health system in Mozambique. Moreover, the activity will build capacity in private clinics by fostering connections and shared learning between the public and private sector. Furthermore, the activity will strengthen private sector supply chain coordination and planning for MCH and FP commodities, and will strengthen a referral system that leverages private sector service delivery.\n","\nSPSD\nAccount\nMO\nProgram\nDirect Funding\nPO  Total\nTotal Funding\nHL.6.8 Cross-cutting Health Systems Strengthening\nGHP-USAID\nICS 08/15/2018 3.2\nNot Applicable\n$300,000\n-\n$300,000\nHL.7.4 Cross-cutting Health Systems Strengthening (FP/RH)\nGHP-USAID\nICS 08/15/2018 3.2\nNot Applicable\n$210,000\n-\n$210,000\nTOTAL\n$510,000\n-\n$510,000\n",FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

Violent extremism in Cabo Delgado has displaced more than 800 million people and has created a climate of fear and distrust in communities. Project activities currently develop community-led economic and social opportunities that strengthen positive relationships and support systems, creating conditions for community members to co-exist peacefully and resolve tensions through non-violent means. Current implementation occurs in three districts and eight communities in southern Cabo Delgado. Interventions include income generation activities, community revitalization, government capacity building, and research. Income generation opportunities are identified through community-based planning exercises, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews. Community revitalization projects increase community engagement and well-being through infrastructure projects and community livelihood opportunities. Community committees with diverse representation are developed to oversee the projects. The Mission will use FY 2021 funds to extend community stabilization activities in northern Mozambique, which will focus on strengthening social cohesion among IDPs and host community members. Funds will support activities to increase service provision and to build confidence between communities and authorities. Activities will be context specific interventions directed by flexible, adaptable contextual research.\n","\nSPSD\nAccount\nMO\nProgram\nDirect Funding\nPO  Total\nTotal Funding\nDR.3.1 Consensus-Building Processes\nDA\nICS 08/15/2018 1.1\nNot Applicable\n$500,000\n-\n$500,000\nTOTAL\n$500,000\n-\n$500,000",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE
